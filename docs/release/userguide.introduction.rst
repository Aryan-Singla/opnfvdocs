Abstract
========

One of Anuket's project goals is to reduce time to integrate and deploy NFV infrastructure and onboard VNF/CNFs
for those who supply components and those who operationalize these platforms. The Anuket community
does this by implementing, testing and deploying tools for conformance and performance of NFV infrastructure, aligned
with industry reference architectures. This document provides guidance and instructions for using platform
features designed to support the tools that are made available in the Anuket |release| release.

This document is not intended to replace or replicate documentation from other
upstream open source projects such as KVM, OpenDaylight, OpenStack, etc., but to highlight the
features and capabilities delivered through the Anuket project.


Introduction

are able to be installed to host virtualised network functions (VNFs) and cloud network functions (CNFs).
This document intends to help users leverage the features and
capabilities delivered by Anuket.
