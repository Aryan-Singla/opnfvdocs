Anuket Test Frameworks
======================

If you have elected to install the Anuket platform using the deployment toolchain provided by Anuket,
your system will have been validated once the installation is completed.
The basic deployment validation only addresses a small part of capabilities in
the platform and you may want to execute more exhaustive tests. Some investigation will be required to
select the right test suites to run on your platform.

Many of the Anuket test projects provide user-guide documentation and installation instructions in :ref:`this document <testing-userguide>`
